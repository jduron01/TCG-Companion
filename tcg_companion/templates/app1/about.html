        <p> A buddy and I decided to make this website for a class project. Though the real purpose of this website was as a collector myself to store my cards into one website to be able to keep tabs on all of them instead of going through book after book. 
            As well as give competitive players an advantage on how to make decks and if the decks are competive viable! Thanks for checking out our website and good luck catching them all!
