        <h1>How to Build a Deck</h1>
        <p>
            You need to have exactly 60 cards to begin building a Pokemon deck. There is no limit to the number
            of cards of each type that you have in your deck, but it is recommended to have 15-20 Pokemon,
            15-19 Energy, and 13-20 Trainers. You only want to have 1-2 types of cards so that you
            do not need many energy types and you want to have trainers that allow you to draw cards and boost
            attacks of your cards.
